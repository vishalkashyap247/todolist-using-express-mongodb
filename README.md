Simply write some thing on input box and hit + button to save your list, if we check the checkbox then the list will deleted this way our website works.
Please note we are using MongoDB to store your todos so that your important todos dont get lost and one more secret thing (which probably you must not tell to anyone) that if you want to list any secret todo just use url like this "https://todolisturlHere/customTodolistNameHere" in which customTodolistNameHere represent custom list name and you can access it and write lists privately. Please dont forget your secret todolist name :P

this is how your data will be stored
